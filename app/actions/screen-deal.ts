/**
 * Function: screenDeal
 * ---------------------
 * This function is responsible for screening deals against a set of criteria in a deal flow management system.
 * It processes uploaded text or docx files, extracts relevant content, and uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to analyze the deal based on the provided criteria.
 *
 * @param {FormData} formData - The FormData object containing the uploaded file, comment, and deal ID.
 *
 * Process Flow:
 * 1. **User Authentication**: Verifies if the user is authenticated.
 * 2. **Input Validation**: Ensures the `file` and `dealId` fields exist in the FormData.
 * 3. **File Processing**:
 *    - Supports `.txt` files (reads content using `file.text()`).
 *    - Supports `.docx` files (extracts content using `mammoth`).
 *    - Throws an error for unsupported file types.
 * 4. **Deal Fetching**: Retrieves deal details from the database using Prisma.
 * 5. **AI Reasoning**:
 *    - Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model via the `generateObject` function to analyze the deal.
 *    - Input: Deal details, screening criteria (extracted from the file), and any additional comments.
 *    - Ensures reasoning adheres to the specified schema (`screenDealSchema`).
 * 6. **Response Handling**:
 *    - Returns a success response with AI-generated reasoning.
 *    - Catches and logs any errors, returning a standardized error message.
 *
 * @returns {Object} - A response object with the following structure:
 *    - type: "success" | "error"
 *    - result (if success): AI reasoning object adhering to the `screenDealSchema`
 *    - message: Descriptive message about the result.
 *
 * Example Response:
 * Success:
 * {
 *   type: "success",
 *   result: { ...aiReasoning },
 *   message: "Successfully screened this deal using AI"
 * }
 *
 * Error:
 * {
 *   type: "error",
 *   message: "Server side Error Occured, please try again!!!!"
 * }
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - OpenAI SDK for AI integration.
 * - Prisma for database operations.
 * - Mammoth for `.docx` file content extraction.
 * - Zod for schema validation.
 * - `@/auth` for user authentication.
 *
 * File Handling:
 * - `.txt` files: Content is read directly using `file.text()`.
 * - `.docx` files: Content is extracted as raw text using `mammoth`.
 *
 * Errors Handled:
 * - Missing or invalid file/dealId.
 * - Unsupported file types.
 * - Deal not found in the database.
 * - Server-side errors during AI processing or database queries.
